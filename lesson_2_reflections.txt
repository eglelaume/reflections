What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, I let git know that a number of files are present in my directory. Initailizing a repository is the first step in setting files up for tracking process. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is like an interim state of my files before committing them to the repository. So I can pick and choose my files from my working directory and make git selectively trak them before commit is being made.
