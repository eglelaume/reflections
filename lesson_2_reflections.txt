How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is like an interim state of my files before committing them to the repository. So I can pick and choose my files from my working directory and make git selectively trak them before commit is being made.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	Make sure I add only one file at a time to the staging area so I can easier control that I only make one commit per logical change/file.
