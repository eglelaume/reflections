When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repository is great when I want to work on my file from different computer or whenever I need to colaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Pulling changes manually assures that the copy will be definitely up-to-date.
